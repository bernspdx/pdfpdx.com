            Community relies on stable connection. All of us deserve the agency to communicate, coordinate, and access what we need on a consistent basis.<br> Not all of us have that agency.

            Donations are <u>not</u> tax deductable as we are <u>not yet</u> an official non-profit. We are a grass roots movement. 100% of donations go to phones/plans. Without sharing personal details on donors or our friends/neighbors, we organize the spending of donations through our Discord linked above, for transparency. Please note that since we aren't a non-profit, we must pay tax on cash donations made to us.

            If you aren't comfortable with donations, great! Here's how to help: Go to Fred Meyers or other related stores and consider purchasing some of the reasonably affordable phone(s) + plan(s) and hand them out to those in need on your own. If you want us to hand them our for you, join our Discord and reach out and we can get the phones/plans to those that need them.
